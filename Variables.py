""" Variables - 

Variables in Python allow us to store information and give it a label that we can use to retrieve that information later.

We assign values to variables by putting the value to the right of an equal sign """

#Because Python is a dynamic language, you’ll notice we don’t need to declare the type of the variables before we store data in them.

x = 42
x = "hello"


#There’s a special type in Python that signifies no value at all. In other languages, it might be called Null. In Python, it’s called None.
x = None

#Python has a very easy way of determining the type of something: with the type() function
num = 42
type(num)
